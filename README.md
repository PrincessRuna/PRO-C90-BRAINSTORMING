# PRO-C90-BRAINSTORMING:

It is common for students to miss class for a variety of reasons, and teachers are frequently concerned that their absences will prevent them from finishing unfinished work. To address this issue, I would like to create an app that uses a database to share notes with all absentee students based on the school's records. Additionally, students who were present could share notes with their absentee classmates. Currently, it is very time-consuming to send daily assignments to multiple students on an individual basis, and frequently this isn't even possible because of the large number of absentee students.I want to work on this application so that students can have atleast the advanatge to complete the work before time , to prevent everything from piling up at once.

Thank You , 
Thats all
